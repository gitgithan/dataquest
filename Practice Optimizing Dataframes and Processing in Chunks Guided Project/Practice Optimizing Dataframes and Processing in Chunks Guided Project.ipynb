I would love to get rid of these credits cards as they have been weighing me down for so long. Everytime I am able to save for something extra for our family of an unexpected expense comes up and months and months of saving a few dollars here and there are out the window. I am just tired of living paycheck to paycheck and feel I need to find away to lower these payments in an honest way without ruining my credit or my pride. <br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1\n",

I feel it is important to point out that although I chose a 5 year loan term, my plan, my goal is to have the entire loan balance paid off betwen years 3 and 4. I chose the 5 year term for the lower monthly payment.  Thank you again.<br><br>  Borrower added on 12/15/11 > To those who have invested to date, I thank you.  You're allowing me to get rid of my high interest debt, be completely debt free in 3 to 4 years and this payment plan affords me the opportunity to save a bit more each month for the future. I have to say this loan process with Lending Club is very interesting and unique. Again, thank you.<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",
       "    Borrower added on 11/21/11 > Dear lender,<br><br>We recently purchased our first home and we plan to use this loan to make home improvements and to set up our home office areas in the home. Also, we are paying a higher monthly amount on a car loan. By consolidating the car loan with the home improvement loan, we are aiming at having just one lower, comfortable monthly payment for both things.<br><br>I've been at my current employer's  for over 15 years. Since we've been advised to do the remodels to the home before we move in, we are still in our rental. In the area of expenses, I'm currently paying $1,250 in rent (last rent payment will be in Dec. 2011) and $573 on our car loan. Our only debts are the car loan (we only have one car) and our brand new mortgage of just under $650 (principal and interest). Our first mortgage payment is due in Jan 2012. By paying off the car loan and consolidating this amount with the home improvement amount, I will only have to pay $548 for my full loan with Lending Club. This means that it will be easy for me to pay back the loan without any problems at all.<br><br>In the past, we ran into some financial problems because (1) we did not budget for expenses, (2) we had no savings set aside, and (3) we often spent more than we earned--either because of mismanagement or unforeseen expenses/emergencies. Happily, a couple of years ago, we took a personal finance managing class that equipped us with the knowledge and insight we needed to change our habit and become good money managers. Now, (1) we have a budget and we stick to it; (2) we set aside savings every month for large upcoming expenses and for emergency deductibles; and (3) we don't buy much on credit at all, and when we do, we pay off any credit card statement balances by due date.<br><br>I will be happy to answer any other questions you may have. Thank you for your consideration and  support. Your help  is much appreciated. Have a great day!<br>    1\n",

And for the past 3 years I have been working for a small business that has been growing despite the current economic hardships.<br><br> Borrower added on 12/10/11 > CAP ONE -Balance is $2,288.<br>GECRB/OLND\\t- Balance is $3,756.<br>AMEX - Balance is $1,385.<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",

       "    Borrower added on 12/09/11 > We are looking to consolidate a couple credit cards that have recently jacked up our interest rates to unreasonable levels.  Just because we have a good credit record, they feel they can make us pay higher rates to accomodate their bad spending habits.  We appreciate your confidence in us.  I hope you will see that we are never late on payments, always pay above the minimum balance and have the financial backing to support this debt.  FYI, the cards we pay off will absolutely be closed.  We have already ceased using them.

       "    Borrower added on 11/19/11 > I am requesting a line of credit for home improvements and furnishings. I have been serving in the United States Navy for the past five years with plans to continue with my active duty service. I have recently purchased a new home, and as closing is coming to an end I am trying to fill the residence with up to date appliances, furnishings as well as minor repairs. This will hopefully ease the transition for my family and I with moving from one place to another by establishing a permanent residence. For those curious about my credit my current score is 667 through TransUnion. There may be an item listed for a late payment but it is in the process of being corrected (Equifax) due to clerical errors. I have never failed to meet the requirements on a financial agreement nor have I declared bankruptcy.

       "    Borrower added on 10/17/11 > The funding will be used to pay down a high interest rate credit card which previously consolidated another card which subsequently has been closed.  We have a good credit rating and have no late or missed payments.  The amount of monthly payment is well within our monthly budget and is less than the amount we have been applying to the card blalance.  This loan allows to to pay off much quicker than continuing to pay the same amount to the card holder.

       "    Borrower added on 10/31/11 > This loan is to invest in several needed resources to start an Internet marketing company which performs website development, SEO, email marketing, content management, and reputation protection to small local businesses. This is a hungry market and a proven business model. Local Internet marketing is on the rise because old media techniques are less effective, while most people are now finding businesses on the Internet. Small business owners need help navigating this type of marketing because it is technical and there is a learning curve. We take care of that part and let the business owner focus on what they do best. We have been developing this business over the course of a year with assistance from three Internet marketing veterans who serve as our coaches.<br/> Borrower added on 11/05/11 > We get our customers by meeting with business owners directly and  building rapport as we discuss the needs and concerns of the owner. We don't wait for people to find us, we go to them. However, we don't try to sell anything. There are no hard sales tactics. We simply build a relationship based on mutual interests and a desire to help where we can. It is only after this initial phase that we offer to do the work that piqued their interest the most.<br/> Borrower added on 11/09/11 > Another important part if our business is working with local businesses to integrate social media into their marketing. B2B companies must utilize LinkedIn, for instance. Facebook is more appropriate for business to customer relationships. In addition, there is YouTube, Twitter, and GooglePlus. We help define up the best strategy for the particular company. We then set up the necessary accounts and teach our clients how to use their social media accounts. Alternately, we will manage these accounts on behalf of the company. Participating in Social Media can be time-consuming, but it is also crucial. Thus, we offer to manage a company's social media profiles. <br>    1\n",

       "    Borrower added on 10/07/11 > Loan is to consolidate several accounts into a fixed rate, fixed payment system.<br/> Borrower added on 10/10/11 > I've made several attempts to update the description with information that I've been asked for. I'm afraid I've violated the rules on every occasion. But, here is another attempt:<br/><br/><br/>I'm an hourly, full time IT employee. I've been employed at current position for almost 7 years. The loan will reduce monthly expenses by double digit percentage by eliminating revolving accounts. This will free up cash flow and cost less in interest.  More importantly, it will be off the books in 3 years.<br/><br/>A large majority of the loan will go to revolving credit accounts. All but one WILL be closed. I always pay more than the minimum unless payments are focused to a higher interest account. While there is interest for this loan, it&rsquo;s considerable less than all but one revolving account. If anything remains, the rest will go to medical and education related debts (no student loans).

If I am funded for this loan I intend to set up an automatic payment as well. I was paying down my credit cards very diligently and was half way to my goal of freedom from debt when I learned that my house needed some major repairs which forced me to use my credit cards. With this loan I will be able to pay off those cards within a set time limit with a real end in sight.<br/>null                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",

       "    Borrower added on 09/21/11 > Purpose of this loan:<br/>After financing the majority of my start up fashion company from my own personal savings  and a small part of it with my credit cards, I am applying this loan for the following reason:<br/><br/>1) To use a major part of this loan (approximately $10,000) to consolidate the credit card debt that I acquired to financed my start-up. Some of the cards have a good rate which I intend to keep, BUT some cards have a high APR averaging 22.95% and I want to consolidate them with this loan. <br/><br/>2) The remaining money will be used to hire an experience Sales Manager on contractual base to help effectively market the collection to the our targeted demographic in the country. However, at the moment we have already secured 16 boutiques and retail stores, with more than 157 Boutiques /stores//buyers across the country interested to see our entire collection catalog coming Jan. 2012.<br/><br/>the start-up and profitability:<br/>The 2012 Spring/Summer collection will be our first collection. Our projection is that we will be profitable from our debut collection (The 2012 Spring/Summer Collection). I have a strong connections to the retail industry and our product will be outstanding in both quality and style with a strong sustainability message that will sell it self.<br/><br/>Personal Finance:<br/>I take my finances very seriously. I have never been late to pay my bills. I am very responsible. Please review my credit history.<br/><br/>My personal life and expenses are very basic, my car (Chevy Malibu 2005) is paid off, and my income can cover all my expenses, plus any monthly loan payment (from this loan after consolidating my credit debt with it). I wouldn't need my start up to be able to pay my loan &ndash;  of which by the way I can firmly project to be profitable from the debut collection.<br/><br/><br/>Thank you for considering my listing. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask. Best.<br/>    1\n",

My monthly expenses are minimal, and I have had good credit standing for nearly ten years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\n",

       "    Borrower added on 08/04/11 > I am using this loan to purchase a folding electric bicycle to travel to and from school/work.  I spend $240 a month on gas. The buses do not run early enough to arrive at school on time. The electric capability will allow me to travel up a couple of steep hills on my route and move me along faster while I pedal. The bicycle's folding capability will allow me to bring it into the classroom to avoid theft, and let me recharge the battery for my return trips. I will also need to buy a carrying case to store the bike in. The trip to school is about 25 miles by car and 35-40 minutes. The trip by bike is 18 miles, 16 miles are on dedicated bike trails. This will save me at least $180 a month in fuel costs.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",

       "  I work for 3 different companies as a contracted consultant with greater than 1 year terms on all 3 contracts. And I also run my own marketing business, which is very stable and profitable. The money in this loan will be used to finance a purchase that was is due in full in the next 30 days, and makes more sense to pay off over a period of time so that I don't have to dip into any business funds. I make over $9,000 per month and over 4,500 is totally disposable income that will be used in partial to pay off this loan each month automatically debited from my checking. A lot of people come on here it seems because they need money, however, I don't need the money it just makes more sense to pay off the purchase over a period of time because there was no financing options available on the type of purchase I made. I make plenty of money and can pay this off in 1 payment if I ever wanted to, I just rather keep my liquid capital to grow my business and make even more money and pay this off over a period of time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",

I care a lot about my credit and when I get this loan the credit card will be cancelled.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1\n",

Already did a loan years ago for a FedEx route for $70k that's paid off now. I'm putting in $30k of my own funds for this Mission Route. Extremely low business risk as it's an established highly profitable route for years. Never missed a loan payment *ever*, for *any* reason, and income from my FedEx route will be used to pay off this loan in the event of an extremely unlikely, unforeseen disaster.

Upon return from my most recent deployment last month, I discovered a small water leak had destroyed my shower surround and flooring and the Insurance company would not cover it, hence my reason for applying to Lending Club.  So far, I am quite pleased with the experience and the number of investors willing to help out.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1\n",

My monthly budget breakdown is 1/3 of my paycheck going to rent and bills, 1/3 going to living and job transit expenses, and 1/3 remaining for general spending and payments.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",

       "    Borrower added on 04/13/11 > GREAT MONTHLY CASH FLOW / LOOKING TO LOWER INTEREST:<br/>I currently have a Lending Club loan (you will see on my credit report) which, of course, is current.  Per my description on that loan, my plan was to refinance all my credit card debt so that I could reduce total interest and pay off more quickly.  That loan was the first half, now I am doing the second half.  Following the funding of this loan my plan is to reduce my overall open to buy by eliminating some unneeded cards. The goal here is to just refinance the debt as opposed to bringing on new debt.  My income is solid, stable and ample to make payments as I believe my profile will show.  This is primarily a move to optimize the cash that I am paying out each month and create a finite path for pay off.  Funds used to pay this loan are already being spent each month and are allocated to my monthly budget, this will just allow those budgeted dollars to work more effectively.  I have worked in the same industry for 17 years now and have had only two employers (including the current one) during that period.<br/>                                                                                                                                 1\n",

I live with a roommate below my means with rent averaging $500 or less a month. I am also currently working on finishing my bachelors in Fashion Merchandising at the local community college, PIMA.

My current company is the largest of it's kind in the US.<br/>Thank you for your consideration, and for helping us to be able to plan a great day!<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",

Part of the driveway needs to be repaved, the garage door and area around the front door need to be freshened up, and I'd love to get the deck stained for outdoor entertaining. Additionally, the tiny and outdated refrigerator that came with the house needs to be replaced, and the banister on my front porch is sagging!

I am able to pay my mortgage, my credit cards and all my bills on time with no missed payments.  Unfortunately, I am only able to make minimum payments, that's the reason for the loan.  The minimum payments can take up to 18 years to pay off.  I know that I am at a point where i will be able to catch up and stay on track.  I have a steady job, and paycheck.  I have a plan of action, and this is part of it, getting a loan.  I appreciate the help dearly.   I know that if i didn't make payments on time, i would be penalize for more money, bad credit and still have to pay.  It's not worth it, and most importantly it's my responsibility to pay back what i borrowed.  I have done  a lot of research  in the past months on how to stay on track, making better choices on budgeting.  I have learned a lot of useful information.  If any one was to look at my credit history, you will see that I am never late and/or never missed any payments.

With them all consolidated I can make one easy payment with a much better interest rate and get my retirement investments back on track!<br/><br/>Thanks, Happy Investing<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",

That is why it is so new compared to others. My age is not reflected by the credit. My recent delinquency came because my Capital One card was charged a yearly fee, which I received no statement for (and I only used that card a few times so I didn't check the online reporting often). I received a call asking when I'd pay my overdue bill, which I had no knowledge of. I paid it off on the phone, for a total amount of around $50 including late penalty. This is the first time anything has been even a day late.<br/> Borrower added on 01/26/11 > Thank you to all of my investors to date and in the future, your vote of confidence in me as an investment is re-assuring to me and well placed.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",

As we begin several new contracts, I want to ensure we have enough operational funds for payroll and supplies.  <br/>I have repaid several loans over my USMC and Business career and have never been late or defaulted on any loans in my lifetime.  I am a very good borrower that pays his bills on time and in full. <br/>My employment is stable and my pay never goes down, only up.  Thanks for your support.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",

       "    Borrower added on 12/13/10 > Citibank raised my rate to 29.9 % even though I have never been late on a payment... I want to get rid of my relationship with them and pay off accumulated balances at a lower interest rate... They also reduced my credit line so that my credit score went down a bit... I have never missed a payment on any obligation and have a 32 year credit track record at I don't intend to besmirch!  Thank you for your help, I am glad that my interest payment will go to a small investor and not reward citibank for their practices.

       "    Borrower added on 12/07/10 > I own a business located in a downtown area.  We are a wellness center and also have retail products.  We offer massage, reiki treatments, craniosacral therapy, reflexology, life coaching and much more.  We teach some self development classes as well.  Our retail products are unique and we feature several locally made products. I opened the business in 2/2009 and have totally self-funded up to this point. We've experienced wonderful growth (47% increase just over last year) and are ready to move into a new (larger) space when my lease expires in February. Sales for the business so far in 2010 have increased 47% over 2009. We are currently in a small (600 sq/ft) space and need to expand in order to increase business. I've found a new location that is larger and in a more visible location in the downtown area. The rental rate is within budget, but I need to borrow this money for security deposit, first month rent (since we will be moving prior to ending the other lease so we don't have any downtime) and to build out an additional room in the space. All other expenses will be covered in the regular budget. <br/>The work I do is truly my life purpose and I am fully committed to its success. I've invested my own money and time and have a sound business expansion plan in place that has been reviewed by my business advisor and accountant. <br/>I do have some personal credit card debt, but the payments are totally within our personal budget and always paid on-time.  The income listed here is just mine, but my husband makes about $100,000.00 per year as well.  <br/>This is my first experience with peer to peer lending, but I am an advocate of the program.  I love the idea that others are benefiting from the interest I will be paying.  Thank you for your consideration.

Lowers my overall interest rate.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",

       "    Borrower added on 11/08/10 > The reason am getting this loan is to get out of my $4,032.00 credit card debt. I have three credit cards with an average APR of 24% and with a loan from the lending club I will be able to substantially reduce the amount that am paying in interest. I have shredded my credits cards to avoid using the cards and therefore increase my debt. Therefore getting this loan will help me get out of debt and also save on the interest that I would be paying to the credit card companies.<br/><br/>What make me a a good borrower is that I have been responsible in paying my credit cards without being delinquent. I have been able to pay off three of my credit cards but now I need help with the remaining ones. I also have a descent credit score and history and have been employed at Powell for the last 3 years. My monthly budget is about $1000 since am staying with a roommate who has been living with me for the last 4 years.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\n",

I have been with company for over 12 years now, and we are doing really well, regardless of the economy.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1\n",

I now have a successful budget plan using Mvelopes, and have been using it for the past year.

Asking the banks for lower APR's has been unsuccessful, so I am here looking for a place to consolidate them to something lower.<br/><br/>The minimum payments for these cards which will be paid off is more than the monthly payment for this loan, so those minimum payments will be directed toward this loan.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",

       "  Lending me money is a sure thing because I have never missed a payment ever in my entire credit history and I am a fanatical budgeter!  I will completely pay off three credit cards with this loan.  Today I make payments totaling 517.00 each month between those three cards so the lower payment of 392.54 is not going to be a problem.  The blended rate of the three cards is 10.1% so funding this loan will help me to pay less interest and give me a little extra money each month!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",

I'm going to need some cash for an upcoming family visit by our in-laws in coming weeks so plan to use about one fourth and the rest three fourth for paying off my individual card balances. <br/><br/>I have always been a very disciplined (eager in repaying to be precise) borrower and an example was I paid off my car loan in just 2 years (~24K) while I took it for 5 or 6 yrs. In the past 5-10 years I have availed many low APR balance transfer offers my investments overseas and have eagerly paid off. All my repayment was always under tight control. I have a very low credit utilization of ~10%-15% of my total revolving credit line and a steady high income with a good employer and practically no risk factors (mainly no mortgage commitment).<br/><br/>I personally like a personal loan than a revolving credit so is my decision to pursue with this offer from Lending Tree and I also liked the low APR!

I plan to use my loan for home improvements which will include a new septic system. <br/>  What makes me a good borrower is that I have always paid my loans on time. I have never made a late payment on a bank loan or credit card payments. At this time I do not currently owe on any loans and I have a zero balance on all credit cards.<br/>  My Monthly expenses are minimal where I do not have any debts so repaying the loan at the rate I have been quoted will not be a problem.<br/>  I currently work for a utility company. I have been employed with them for ten years.

Then I would like to slowly start looking for homes.<br/> Borrower added on 12/13/10 > I have been working with my company for a few years now. The company is doing well now and the stocks are slowly trending upwards. I try to be a wise investor myself. So, here is the details of how I plan to use my funds so you can chose wisely as well:<br/>I tried negotiating lower rates with all the banks but they denied it because of high revolving balance. I was never late on payments or skipped out on payments. I hate the amount of interest I am paying, so I need this loan to consolidate the debt and lower the interest rates. This loan will help me build my savings while making sure the debt is paid off in a couple years.<br/>Toyota Loan - $9,297.00@2.90% -- At $592.86/month which is my actual payment, it will be paid off in 15 months. I will not consolidate this, as this loan has a lower rate than this loan and is not a revolving account.<br/>HSBC $6,808.00 @19.99% - Will consolidate this. This account was previously owned by Suzuki. But when HSBC bought it they hiked the rates. I closed this account.<br/>Chase $5,059.60@17.99% - Will consolidate this. This was previously owned by Circuit City and had low interest deals. But Chase bought it and boosted the rates. I will keep this account open to keep my revolving balance low. But, I do not plan to run it up anymore. I will use cash for future purchases.<br/>E-Trade $9,126.00@19.99% - I will keep this open but pay it off partially with ESPP in Feb of next year and renegotiate a lower rate when my revolving balance is lower.<br/><br/>I am not interested in buying a home for a couple of years. I am planning on saving until I have 20% down payment, because I do not want to make PMI payments.<br/>Regardless, I am looking right now at the housing market and trends. Even though I have cash to cover all my debts, I was saving it in case a beautiful house came up on the market that is within my budget and is close enough to work.<br/>    1\n",

I am taking this loan because I have some immediate cash flow needs.

       "    Borrower added on 11/12/10 > Thank you for the funds received so far.  This loan will be used to pay off 2 very high interest Credit Cards that I am tired of paying interest on and just can't seem to get the principal down.  Also will be used for a some home improvements.  I am very credit concious, seeing as I am a Sr. Mortgage Loan underwriter, I know how important credit is and make sure my bills are paid on time.  This loan would also enable me to put more in savings instead of paying the high interest fees on these charge cards.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n",

I have made every attempt to sell for what I owe and the housing market is just horrible so I took the best offer and now need a loan to pay off the mortage.

       "    Borrower added on 10/09/10 > -- Good day sir/madam, My Loan is to be used for the purchase of one DVD rental/retail machine (similar to the popular redbox(R) machines/business), along with purchase of about 200DVDs for starters to get the rental going.Based on my discussions with the machines producer:- (Estimated) Machine=$16K+tax;DVD cost per DVD + the casing(rental type) + RFID Tag=$18; for 200 gives $3600. The loan will help with these purchases/acquisitions, and I am still taking care of other costs such as insurance (about $1000/yr), merchant account, broadband service, etc. Based on my research and projection (estimates), estimated yearly revenue for a good scenario comes to $45,000 on the machine, and estimated yearly expense is about $25,000 (machine cost is not included in this).Thus Net-Revenue is $20,000 out of which I can &quot;deduct the machine cost easily&quot; to payoff the loan within 2 to 3yrs (without even having to use my personal paycheck).The loan will already be taken out of my account, so technically its already coming-out from my incoming paychecks- (and the above revenue would replace my paycheck :-) ).<br/>-- I would be highly honored to have you fund my loan;I am a very promising entrepreneur (as you can see through my concise summary),and funding my loan will get me one step closer to setting up my own DVD/Film rental small business.Thank you.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",

I'm a good borrower because I understand the importance of paying on time, consistently.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",

       "    Borrower added on 10/21/10 > I graduated from Law School a little over two years ago.  During my law school years, I was studying and not working and accumulated some debt.  The interest rate on the credit cards are killing me.  I have made an enormous effort to pay them down.  After considering my options, I prefer to simply get a loan that will pay them all off, chop the cards up into little pieces (except one), and be credit card debt free in less than five years.  The payments I'm making on my cards now are significantly higher than what my monthly payment on this loan will be, so I also anticipate paying this loan off sooner than the five years.

       "    Borrower added on 10/28/10 > The purpose of the loan is to renovate a property I purchased on foreclosure so that I can move into it, sell my current property (which I have approx. $40,000. equity in and move into the renovated property.  This will decrease my housing costs by about 700.00 per month.  I may also use a portion of it for debt consolidation.<br/> Borrower added on 11/04/10 > I have a stable income.  I have a professional degree and have been continuously employed in my field since earning my degree.  I have a very loyal client following, enjoy my work very much and plan to continue working in my current capacity until I retire.  I take my financial responsibilities seriously and have never defaulted on a loan.<br/><br/>I purchased a foreclosed property this past summer.  The property is a fenced acre with a double wide manufactured home on it.  Manufactured homes are very common in this part of the country.  The well and septic system were inspected prior to purchase and found to be in good condition but the home itself is in need of repair.  The property was initially purchased with the intention of selling the manufactured home and purchasing a modular home to be installed on the property.  At the same time I had the home I am currently living in on the real estate market.  My intention was to sell my home and use the proceeds to pay off debt and have cash on hand for emergencies.  By doing this and moving into a less expensive modular home (on the foreclosed property) I would be reducing my monthly mortgage payment as well as my total mortgage debt amount substantially.<br/><br/>I had a buyer lined up for the manufactured home but shortly before he purchased it there was a death in his family and he could no longer proceed with the purchase..... more to follow<br/> Borrower added on 11/04/10 > ...I began to feel that a new opportunity was presenting itself.  My current mortgage on that property is below $300. per month.  The mortgage is a land loan so I actually own the manufactured home outright.  If my husband and I were able to renovate the manufactured home ourselves we would be living in a nice home on a desirable piece of land for a very small monthly mortgage.  Really when you think about it, less than $300. per month is almost like living for free.  The renovation loan would be paid off relatively quickly (as compared with a mortgage) so in a few years our only debt would be a small mortgage and possibly a car payment.<br/><br/>I am a conservative spender.  In spite of this I have credit card debt.  My goal is to pay it off with the sale of my current house.  The reason for much of that debt is twofold.  My husband has had many health problems.  The cost of medical procedures and medications has been significant.  In addition, it has also resulted in gaps in his employment that have obviously resulted in less income.  He was also laid off from his job about 8 months ago after a massive downsizing (aobut 80% of his coworkers lost their jobs) in his department.  His health has improved greatly over the last few months and he has returned to school and is due to graduate in about 2 months.  I expect he will earn a reasonable salary once he graduates.  He has had 2 different employers approach him about a job after he graduates.<br/>    1\n",

       "    Borrower added on 10/14/10 > I have been working for Baron Aviation just over 12 years now and 5 years for a sister company before transferring. My overall manager position is very stable now and will be for many years to come. I plan on using the funds for home improvement projects on a house that I have owned for 7 years now. Projects that will build strong equity. I am very dedicated in my repayment plans past and present for any loan I have had. Any debt I am currently paying is set up for automatic withdrawl to assure the payment is made on-time or even early in most cases. I appreciate any investor that believes in me and can rest assured that I will honor my re-payment commitment.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1\n",

       "    Borrower added on 09/09/10 > Greetings, <br/>I am a full time military officer in the Arkansas Army National Guard with a monthly income of $4200 and the job is 100% stable.  I plan on using the funds in order to pay off 2 credit cards with an APR of 18%.  The lower interest rate from your loan will save me a few years of interest, however I plan on paying this loan off around June - July 2011.  I pay all bills on time and make extra payments when my funds provide the means to do so.

       "    Borrower added on 09/13/10 > My ultimate goal is to be debt free.  I am working on ending my use my use of credit cards which is why I am applying for this loan.  It seems every time they raise my limit, I spend it.  I am working hard to reduce my debt. I started working at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney as a client service associate last November.  I am studying for my Series 7 license, which will allow me to increase my income even more.  I really appreciate you taking the time to consider me for a loan. I am raising my niece (I'm her legal guardian) and she also just started college this year.  I'm trying to teach her to stay away from credit cards and live on cash.  Thanks again.

I'm just ready to get rid of these cards for good and have a clean slate!<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",

We live with her parents , so no rent/mortgage  or food bills<br/><br/>my current expenses are<br/><br/>gas  ($100) per month<br/>cell phone ($65) month<br/>credit cards/bike ($700) per month which i will be consolidating into this one loan  to reduce my payments and actually pay off the balance and not just hover at the current balances because of the high interest rates and mimimum payments.<br/> Borrower added on 07/22/10 > Ive also been at this job for 10 years, its somewhere i plan on being for a long time.     I will have the loan automatically paid from my checking account so i wont be able to miss a payment.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\n",

I hope that I can get a full 100% funding this time so I can successfully build a new kitchen in my home. <br/><br/>I am getting promoted soon and will have to relocate. Before I do so I want to add more value to my home by remodeling and upgrading my kitchen. Last July I purchased a foreclosure and a new kitchen will add tremendous value to it adding an instant return when I have to sell it to move. I currently Owe about $188,000 left on the home and there is roughly $20-22,000 in equity in the home. I am choosing this as option #1. I do not want to pull equity out of my home unless it was a do or die situation. <br/><br/>If you have any questions feel free to ask and I will get back ASAP. <br/><br/>Cheers<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",

My business is starting to get its traction and I anticipate great growth during the summer months.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1\n",

       "    Borrower added on 07/12/10 > Thank you for your consideration. I am requesting this loan to consolidate my consumer debt with a lower rate. My income is stable, as well as my job, as you can see, I've been employed with the same company for almost 11 years.  I have made regular payments on my outstanding debt comfortably, and always pay well above the minimum payment due,  I have never had a delinquent account and never pay late, as the details of my risk profile will no doubt indicate.  I'm simply looking to have only 1 payment versus several with a fixed interest rate.  Best case scenario, I'd like to have this loan paid off before the end of the 36 month term.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",

       "    Borrower added on 07/09/10 > Requesting a Personal loan.  I have a steady job as a LT Fire Fighter for the past 5.5 years and have paid all debts on time  - no derog payments reported.<br/> Borrower added on 07/16/10 > The use of this loan is for my wedding.  My fianc&eacute; and I planned a March 2011 wedding, but due to my step fathers illness (chronic rejection of lung transplant) we had to move the date up with hopes that he is able to attend our wedding.  Based on moving the date up it has changed our budgeting as far as paying the large deposits at an earlier date so we decided to apply for a personal loan because it would be much easier to make payments on a personal loan with a lower rate instead of incurring  credit card debt at a much higher rate.  If approved for this personal loan, our intentions are to pay this loan in full within 12 months of receiving the funds.  Is there a prepayment penalty?  <br/><br/>Thank you in advance for your time.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",

My parents were no longer able to fully pay for my tuition and extra expenses out of pocket, as they had done prior to the economic downfall.  Additionally as I approached the end of my college career, I asked for less and less hours to ensure doing well in my final few classes.  Now that school isn't currently in the picture, and I'm secured in the federal employee system; I anticipate being comfortable paying the potential loan off.  Understandably, I've had skeptical lenders ask questions regarding how I would manage being timely and consistent with payments while moving out if I've been unable to manage this at home with my parents.  In my defense, again as just mentioned, this debt was primarily due to charging my tuition while working less than typical part time hours.  Secondly, I've been managing making at least my minumum payments.  Only twice, I missed my due date, as I overlooked the date and wasn't more than one day delinquent.  Therfore, I really do know I can manage rent in addition to the loan payment without accummulating aditional debt.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1\n",

       "    Borrower added on 07/17/10 > I plan to use this loan to replace a few household appliances.  I have really been needing them, and decided rather than using a Home Depot credit account and having an open ended credit line, I would apply for a loan to set up a results yeilding, auto-pay plan.  It took alot to convince myself to apply for a loan instead of using a Home Depot credit card, though, because I am employed with the company and I generally prefer the companies quality services over most other options.  I feel the loan will prove my credit worthiness, as that is my overall goal for the next few years in order to prepare for a mortgage.<br/> Borrower added on 07/20/10 > I have had many questions asking my intentions for the loan for which I am applying.  <br/><br/>I intend to use the loan money, I have applied for, to purchase new appliances for my home.  When I moved in, I brought my washer and dryer with me.  Well, they have just recently decided to kick the bucket!  So, the goal is to purchase a new washer, dryer, and, while I am at it, I figured a new refridgerator is probably a good idea also.  Any left over money will be put toward storage shelving for the laundry room.  My application shows that I rent a home.  That is hardly the case, my fiance owns the home we live in.  I do not have to pay mortgage nor any of the utilities because he handles that, so long as I maintain the upkeep on the house.  Since that response was not an option, I thought the best way to state it would be to say I am a renter.  My debt to income ratio may look high, but I have set money aside to pay off my revolving credit each month.  I just did not want to expend a large amount of money out of my account in case of unexpected expenses.  Thank you for your consideration.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",

Work has been stable and strong for years now since we are one of two repair facilities left in the US. <br/>As for a monthly budget, I pull in around $2,900 a month with only about $900 in expenses. <br/>For why am I a good borrower, well lets say that I believe in the old school philosophy, that when a man gives his word on a debt, he pays it in full and on time.<br/> Borrower added on 06/22/10 > Just wanted to add, that this is my 4th bike I have purchased since I started riding 9 years ago.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\n",

       "    Borrower added on 02/08/10 > I'm going to purchase an ATV for my daughter. I plan to pay this loan off within a year or two because right now I'm setting aside all of my extra money along with my taxes to pay off my current debt within this year also. Course I've set aside enough to pay this monthly payment. I've never been delinquent on anything or any loan in my life. I've had a credit line since 2001 and its perfect. I plan to be debt free after this year and will probably invest some of my money on lending club later on. I work in information technology in education so I have one of the best stable jobs out there. Again, this loan will probably be paid off in the first year or two and my credit score shows my perfect history.

       "    Borrower added on 04/15/10 > I will be using this loan to consolidate my debt.  For several years I worked part time as a certified horseback riding instructor in addition to my full time job in social services.  In August of 2009 I was injured by a horse during a lesson and have not yet been able to return to teaching.  Fortunately, my full time job is stable and I retained an attorney who's in the process of negotiating a settlement.  In the meantime, I am getting married in July of this year and want to start married life with as little debt as possible.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1\n",

       "    Borrower added on 05/10/10 > Hello everyone, I'm just trying to survive the summer because I'm stuck with paying double rent for a couple of months and helping the family out with some financial matters.  My car's due for maintenance and I'd like to make sure that I don't become delinquent on any of my payments.  I assure you, I will never default on this loan either.<br/> Borrower added on 05/10/10 > If you're still in doubt, I do hope you reconsider because I haven't been late on any payments (whether it's a credit card bill or a student loan) in over 2 years and I'm not about to start now. I have a steady job and get steadily paid for 11 months of the year.  The last 4 years, I have saved enough each year to survive the 1 month I don't get paid...but the little extra I have saved up is not enough to cover two rents for two months AND help my family out.  I need help - and I would have never requested a loan if I knew I couldn't pay it off.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\n",
       "    Borrower added on 03/09/10 > I plan to use the funds to consolidate high interest credit cards. The total consolidated is $19,631.65 with interest rates between 18.99-23%. By consolidating them I looking to get a lower rate and one manageable payment to pay them off quicker. My monthly expenses are as follows: Rent: $900.00; Car Insurance for myself and my two daughters is: $163.77; I have no car payment; my utilities average between 120.00-232.00, depending on the time of year. I have no home phone, just a cell which is $120.00; my food averages at about $300.00 a month; I have a student loan for $397.21. I am a single mother with two girls who are college age and attend college. I have never defaulted on a loan. I have always made my payments and have strong sense of responsiblity in fulfilling and any and all obligations I am responsible for. The last year and half has been an extremely tough for my family and I. As is with a lot of people I realize. My oldest daughter had some personal issues that as a mother I could not turn her away, so I helped her. In  helping her I aquired debt on my credit cards. Additionally there were medical problems that my insurance company did not cover or they only paid a certain percentage. I was forced to put the balances on my cards. It has been a very difficult time, but I am deteremined to make it through. I appreciate any help that can be given. I have always honored my debts and have always strived to do the best with what I have been given. I have never, nor do I ever intend to file bankruptcy. I will do what is necessary and work as hard as is necessary to fulfill my obligations. Thank you for any consideration you give me.

I apologize for the inaccurate information I provided previously.<br/> Borrower added on 03/15/10 > I have had several investors today ask the particulars regarding the remaining revolving credit not combined in this loan request. I did not have the information in front of me to properly address it at the time, and as I have no internet service at home, I needed to call and get the details pertaing the remaining revolving credit balance. One lenders asked why I only requested $19,750.00 rather than the full amount of my debt. The answer for that question is: I was only allowed to request that amount, and according to the rules I read regarding a loan with Lending Club, a loan cannot exceed $25,000.00. I took the credit bills I have that had the highest percentage rates and added them up and that is how I determined the amount I did. The rates of these cards ranged from 18.99% to 23%. By consolidating and obatining a lower rate, I felt I would achieve 1.) a lower rate, which mean't less paid out in interest in the long run and less time to pay down money owed; 2.) would enable me to take high interest cards and combine them into one manageable payment; 3.) less hardship on my family. <br/><br/>The remaining revolving credit (totaling: $18,223.98) is care credit for $5,898.36; Barclay Mastercard for 4,435.88; Chase Visa $2,168.36; Chase $5,731.38; <br/><br/>I have stated the reasons for the debt, and I have covered, I think, the questions asked. If not, please feel free to ask any other questions you may have as a prospective lender. Thank you for time and consideration.<br/>     1\n",

I would pay this back very quickly...I just don't have the on-hand cash at this moment.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",

Thanks.<br/> Borrower added on 02/08/10 > Please also not that i also have an auto loan which will be paid off in roughly 1 year and i have another personal loan which i used for educational purposes. Part of this loan is also going to be used for educational purposes. Both loans are with my bank. I have made all loan payments on time and this can be verified. Again i will have no problems making payments.

Not due to my credit, my credit is perfect. I only have my primary mortgage and have lived here for 7 years yet I don't have enough equity.

We will be putting the money that we are currently using to pay off our revolving debt into savings to save for a down payment on a new home in the next five years.  The monthly payment for this personal loan is small which allows us to save a lot and pay this loan over time.<br/> Borrower added on 03/16/10 > Mistyped an answer to the question regarding our 7K revolving debt...I meant to say that \"we\", my wife and I, accumulated debt as she was going through school to get her doctorate and that \"we\" put it on a card with 0% interest to pay it off.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",

       "    Borrower added on 03/15/10 > Hello fellow investors!  I would like to start out by thanking you for trusting your money to help others in need.  This loan will be used to get my wife's credit cards paid off, finally.  Over the past year, I've worked on paying off my credit card debt and was able to pay most of it and now I wan't to help my wife get out of 2 14% credit cards that she has.  The cards have been cut so she doesn't get tempted to use them.  About my job, I'm in the Air Force working as a computer operator.  I've been in for 10 years and have a great carreer ahead of me as I'm working towards serving my 20 years in and starting my own business.  I am an Staff Seargeant and working on my Masters in Business Administration.  Being in the military has helped me keep a good control over my finances and influences me to keep doing good or face consequences.  At this point, I own 3 homes.  Two of them are rented so I'm getting a good stream of income from them.  I have a line of equity loan on my house for $27,000 that I'm paying on at 3.5% interest rate.  The min payment is about 60 bucks.  The other homes, payment is 560 and I'm getting 750 and the last home is 929 and I'm getting 950.  I'm wanting to pay off this loan within 1 year by putting all extra cash into paying this loan off.  I just didn't want my wife to pay all that interest.  Please let me know if you have any further questions to make your decision an easy one.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\n",

       "    Borrower added on 02/01/10 > Hello investors! When the economy first fell, I lost my job. I was unemployed for some time, and had to use my credit cards for everything because of the lapse between the loss of employment and the receipt of unemployment. This year, since I now have a wonderful stable job and am about to receive a raise, my new years resolution is to use this loan to get completely out of debt from my other creditors (which is a dream in itself) to fulfill my dream of publishing my novel this summer. Hopefully I'll be able to thereafter invest with lendingclub for others. Please help this come true!<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\n",

       "    Borrower added on 01/15/10 > The changes to the credit card industry this past year prompted me to become familiar with P2P borrowing as an alternative to using CC when/if I need funds.  As the owner of several rental properties, I have to be prepared. Since I do not use my CC often, and will soon be facing the new CC fees, including the \"inactivity fees\" my plan is to reduce the number of cards that I have, and use the P2P method instead.

       "  My wife and I are super responsible, and have the income and credit to show that we will pay off this loan.  We just recently paid off our car early, and usually put around $1000 per month into our savings.  Since we had a fire at our house, we have been saving money for the repairs, and have been living in a damaged home.  We have started doing some of the work with our savings. However, Bank of America will not release all of the insurance money to us until we have completed what they see as 50% of the work.  This loan would get us to that point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",

       "  I would like this loan to help purchase a reliable low-mileage automobile.  My current vehicle is beginning to become worrisome.  This loan, in addition to my savings I have set aside, would allow me to buy a car I can depend on for years, rather than buy something that could put me in this same situation a year from now.  I have over five years of completely unblemished credit history, excellent debt to income ratio, and a good, stable job at a strong automotive supplier.  Credit blemishes that occurred when I was younger and had less reliable income jobs are preventing me from getting reasonable interest rates.  My rocky start to financing is long in the past, but not quite long enough yet.  The road to repair has been long, but this loan should also put me over the hump and in the clear completely.

Thanks.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\n",

I've been paying it down steadily (particularly over the last year), but the constantly increasing rate is killing me.  I'm a hard worker who has held two jobs (banker and part-time history professor) for the last seven years.  I'm just trying to get a handle on the interest I'm paying so that I can knock out this debt.  My intention is to pay off all my debt in the next year and half, so that I can go back to school for my second bachelor's degree.  That will make three degrees total (with the bachelor's & master's degrees that I already have).  I'm explaining all of this, so that you can see that I am responsible and dedicated.  This is a good investment, and I assure you that this loan will be paid in full - most likely early.<br/> 575321 added on 11/18/09 > I am the sole wage earner in my household, and I have no dependents.

       "  Dear Lender,  I currently have 5 credit cards which all have low interest rates, but as of last month 2 of my larger cards ($5000 balance on each) switched over to the standard 23.95% APR because the introductory 0% offer expired. From looking at my credit history you will see that I do not have a single late payment on any of my credit card or auto loan accounts. I am looking to consolidate all of my credit card balances into one fixed loan through LendingClub.com.

       "  Last year I bought a single house as Investment.  I was hoping that after I was done remolding the rental I would be able to take out a home equity but most banks only give out home equitys on your primary resident and other banks only want to loan out 40,000.00  and up. I have good credit and would like to borrow 10,000.00 to pay off the credit card that I used. The loan can be for 36 months, 48 months or 60 months.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n",

       "  I am one of the unlucky people that Chase decided to increase 5% of my total balance as my minimum fee. I have been with Chase for over 10 years and had no issue paying them more than the minimum balance fee. I never missed a payment since it is auto deducted from my checking account.   I was one of the few that got suckered into their balance transfer scheme. I transferred into Chase for their 3.99% until the life of the balance.  I decided to balanced transfer $25,000 and pay $750 per month so that I can finish within 3 years.  Now almost 7 months into the deal, I have to pay Chase $1250 per month due to their 5% increase.  They told me I have a choice, either play $1250 per month, close the account and pay in full, or take the 9.99% APR hike instead of the 3.99% APR.  This is why I need your help. I want to transfer all my remaining balance and get rid of Chase and their devious plan to exploit on unfortunate consumers. This is an outage and everyone who are with Chase should file a class suit.  I hope you undestand my situation and thank you for all your help and support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n",

Thanks and sorry again for the 'ignore'.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",

       "    583878 added on 12/02/09 > My growing boy needs clothes!  He's down to five pairs of pants that he can wear.  I've never had a need for clothes like this as my sister usually gives me her sons clothes that he has outgrown.  Well now my baby (he's actually 11) is growing more than my nephew and there are no more hand me downs.  I would also like to pay off a couple of small credit cards.  I am very good with my money but it has been tough the last couple of years as they have taken away our bonuses and raises at work and common household expenses and utilites seem to be increasing. I also just had to do much needed maintenance on my 8 year old car that has put me in a rut.  I have a very stable job that I have been at for almost 6 years in January. I would really appreciate your assistance and promise to pay back every penny. Thank you!<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n",

I am in just a need of some assistance to meet this goal, I am also setting a goal to have this paid off before the 36 time frame.<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",

I have really good credit rating and would like to keep it that way.

But in the meantime, I dig my head into anything that makes money. Right now I'm working on a deal for importing Russian preserves, including jams, pickles and other canned goods; the only thing that is holding me back is the fact that I don't have the needed resources for me to deal a large and longer terms contract with these people. Thats the purpose of this loan to get the right location, resources where I can manage, distribute and handle similar deals.  Ive knocked other banks for this business loan, but all of them are looking for minimum of 3 years of business history in order for them even to consider for a small business loan.

I am a home owner, and have been for 20+ years with no late payments ever. The same for multiple vehicles I have purchased over the years.

       "  Hello all,   I own a home and have been wanting to remodel the kitchen for sometime. Unfortunately, my bank isn't allowing me to take a small home equity loan, so I'm looking to you, the gracious lending club members to help me out. As you see, I have little to no debt and have a solid income to repay this loan. I simply don't have the lump some of money on hand.

       "  Greetings:  I am a 30-something small business owner who would like to pay off the outstanding balance on my one and only credit card. I've had an automatic withdrawal of the minimum amount taken out of my account for the last year and a half (around $275) but with an APR of 18% the balance is not going anywhere. So, I feel confident I'll have no problem paying around $340 a month to pay the debt off.  I've been in business for ten years and luckily my work flow has continued to be steady throughout the past year. Several years ago, I used a credit card to help build my office for my business and the interest quickly escalated out of control. I've now learned from experience that credit cards are not a good fit for me and would LOVE to pay the card off and take on a Lending Club loan instead. I'd much rather pay my interest directly to Lending Club members then to the credit card company. Thanks for your consideration!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n",

I have a very stable job or i should say jobs as I also work as a Physical Therapist on the weekends.  This expense just came up for a family member.  I make more than enough monthly to cover all my expenses, but this just came up and need this lump sum soon. 563501 added on 10/27/09 > My work history is as follows:  I have worked as a Physical Therapist for 14 + years.  I quit for 2 years to go back to school to get my nursing degree which i received last year and am now working full time as a Dialysis Nurse, while also working as a contract Physical Therapist on the weekend.  My jobs are very stable and I get new job offers honestly on a daily basis.  My credit history is VERY important to me and I never want to jeopardize that and I think my credit score is an indication of that.  I take pride in my good credit rating.

       "   I am seeking out a loan to consolidate high interest credit card debt. I have been employed as a registered nurse for 13 years and have very stable income. I am married and in a stable home. I am not looking to further extend my credit, but rather to pay it off. The loan will be used to pay off my credit cards and close my accounts to these higher intersest lines. My car is paid off and my husband pays the mortgage on our home therfore my primary financial focus is now to pay off debt. The payment on this loan will not be additional money from my income but the same minimum monthly credit card payments used much more wisely! I have borrowed from various lenders in the past with a good credit history and intend to continue to pay my debts in the same reponsible manner. I consider myself to be an excellent candidate for this loan and hope that you do as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n",

       "  Recently divorced and adjusting finances to further my debt consolidation plan. I have taken on much of my ex spouse's debt and pay monthly child support, in addition to a high cost of living in the DC metro area.   I have taken steps to reduce my monthly obligations by downsizing my vehicle, reducing unnecessary spending, and increasing my salary. I have mapped a 5 year plan for divorce recovery and am aggressively pursuing fiscal solvency.   I would like to request loan to consolidate one of my revolving credit accounts into a structured installment account to reduce APR and apply more repayment to actual principle. This will allow me to avoid the \"minimum payment trap\" and to better manage my financial responsibilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",
       "  This money will be used solely for the purpose of eliminating high interest rate credit card debt quickly. I've been carrying this debt for a number of years, but seem to be unable to pay it down in a reasonable period of time, due to the increasing interest rate.  I've always paid on time, and always applied a significant amount towards the principle, but the outrageous interest rate makes it very difficult to pay down. I have absolute confidence in my ability to pay down a loan of this amount quickly, at a reasonable interest rate.  I have a stable, well paying job, and I supplement my income with additional freelance work, which I do from home.  I have many financial goals that I'd like to achieve, that simply aren't possible under this looming debt.  Elimination of this debt within three years is possible with this solution, which opens up a number of possibilities for me financially.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",
       "  I am recently divorced, raising 2 teenaged boys.  I have $15,000 in credit card debt that was accumulated from my ex-husband but I was left with to pay.  I've already cashed in an IRA from my previous employer while I was married to pay some of my ex husband's debt.  I work full-time but with raising 2 boys it's not enough.  This money would help me pay off these 2 cards to get back on my feet.

       "  I'm currently paying the minimums on several credit cards and I'm making very little progress.  This loan request is intended to shorten the process of eliminating the credit card debt while simultaneously increasing my credit score and establishing a relationship with p2p lending. The cards that I intend to eliminate are from reputable lenders such as Bank of America ($5500). My interest rates are high because of inaccurate information on my credit report.

       "   This loan will pay for an operation to remove what has become a large benign growth in a sensitive area.  I've been at my current job & address for over 10 years, have very good credit (the last time I checked), and have the ability to increase my income at will (I am a relatively well-known musician in this area and can perform as much as I want). My day job is in the fire safety business; I have a state fire extinguisher license; my current job is very stable, but companies are always looking for licensed technicians, so my employment future is very stable.

       "  I am completing the financial proceedings of a divorce and I need to hire an attorney to negotiate the equitable distribution of the Assets. These proceeds will be used to hire the attorney and to stabilize my financial affairs.  As an additional fund-raising action, and as a risk mitigating hedge against this loan, I am also in the process of refinancing my condominium.  Its appraised value was $267,000 in 12/2006.  The target proceeds are $5,000 - $20,000.  The actual amount will depend on property appraisal.  My condo is in \"North Bethesda, MD\"... approx. 4 miles North of Bethesda (an appreciating to stable market) and 6 miles South of Rockville (designated a declining market).  The need to borrow is created by timing.  I estimate that the current value of the divorce assets is approximately $200,000.  My ex-wife and I were married in the State of NC.  NC law indicates an equitable distribution should apply.  The goal is to invest up to $20,000 in hiring a competent divorce attorney to achieve the $100,000 in assets.    The assets from the divorce will be used to settle all debts.  Remaining proceeds would start a retirement fund, begin investments and be used to fund additional education. Presently I have an MBA and JD (I did pro-bono, some regulatory and in-house counsel work for startups previously, as a member of the Bar, but I do not practice law now).  I use that education in my work in enterprise procurements for a large government entity.                                                                                                         1\n",

       "  My wife and I have been in an apartment since I graduated from the University with a degree in Electrical Engineering.  I earn $76,000/yr as a systems engineer at an aerospace consulting firm and my wife is a realtor but she also has a teaching degree - she taught for 6 years, but she likes her new job more.  When our friends were buying homes we didn't think they could afford, we stayed in our apartment and paid of her 2002 Volkswagon car off and student loans, and almost all of mine.   I was promoted this year to the mid-level engineering position of senior-engineer and we both thought it was time to buy a house.  We waited until earlier this year to finally buy a house because we wanted to have only one car note and a small amount of student loan debt beore we were comfortable making the move.  We bought a 1979 $115k home in a nice neighborhood, I got a 5.0% rate, and our 30 year fixed plus insurance and tax is a mortgage payment of ~$950.  My wife wants to install new cabinetry in this older home, granite counter tops, and remodel the master bath.  What i would like to do is borrow here to update this house to the one she really wants.  We were both very responsible during the real estate boom, and we watched it bust from the sidelines aas we saw CDOs and ARMSs causing havoc to others.  What I'd like to do is reward ourselves in this way, knowing that with our responsible handling of finances, my recent promotion and dependable income, and with the money we didn't pay via an overpriced new home a loan of $25k is well within our budget.  Thanks!    1\n",

       "   My central a/c is on it's last legs.  I had the system installed 23 years ago when we first moved into this house.  The last time it was repaired, the company could not believe how long I have had it - and they reminded me that the main coils will go out at any time.  I had 2 companies give me quotes for a whole new system - the best being $4894.00 all included.    Looking at the specs of the system and also reasearching this information, the new a/c will be much more efficient, almost saving me enough each month on electric to pay for the loan. Plus, living in South Florida prices will increase as the Summer begins and the demand increases.  I have recently subscribed to Equifax and my credit history is improving as I have been very diligent over the last 4 years and have also completely paid off all my credit cards as of May of this year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",

       "   Purpose of this loan:  I need to get my basement fixed and should resurface my 5 car port.   Due to water damage the wall on the south west side of the building in bowing in, and getting more and more severe. In addition the outside needs to be regraded to avoid further water damage.

In addition I would like to resurface the 5 car parking lot, where the asphalt is crumbling away due to the hard winters here in the Midwest.

       "  I would like to use this loan to consolidate my debt in one monthly payment and also get a better interest rate. All of my credit cards have 21% APR or above so any rate below that would be great.  I am a full time production manager at a manufacturing plant and have been employed there for the past six years. I am very hard work and responsible with my finances. I have never been late or delinquent on any payment and I plan to pay this loan off as soon as possible.

       "  Hi... I would like to pay off my credit card debt for myself and my husband.  We have 4 cards with higher than usual rates and would like to pay them completely off.  We have recently started a small home business and saw your article on the Lender's Club in Success magazine and thought what a great idea.  We were about to consolidate these cards through conventional means but this seems so much better.  We were very impressed with this service and hopefully as our business grows we can also become investors!

       "  Id like to pay off my credit card debt completely and have a low monthly payment because i want to buy my girlfriend of 3yrs a ring and with lower monthly payments i can save for it faster.  I accumulated the debt from when i was younger and had the silly mind set that a credit card is like free money.  I have greatly learned from that. I just want to be done with credit cards. I am a great candidate for a loan because i have never had a late payment in my life. I always paid more then double the min. monthly payments. I dont have kids or dependents. I live rent free with family in a big house. (I do labor work like cutting grass, work on their cars, take care of the home, etc. in exchange for rent free living.)  I have a very stable and well paying job which ive been at for almost 3yrs.  Im a work horse. Ive never been unemployed since ive started working at 16yrs old. I would greatly apprieciate the help.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",
       "  Adding on to my home to increase it's value. I plan on living in our home till my 13 yr old is done with college so we need to make it meet our needs. I'm a very responsible borrower and have never made a late payment on anything for the past 20 yrs. My bank I have been with for 14 yrs is not doing any personal lending so that's why I'm giving this a shot. This is not something I have to do, I just would like to do this project. So if I can get a fair loan deal for the amount I need to complete the work I'm ready. Thanks!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",

       "  I have recently left my firm to go out on my own and start my own solo law practice. While my overhead is relatively low (rent and advertising, primarily) I would like to have a line of credit to pay myself a modest salary and cover my expenses. Money will be coming in immediately, but I need to cover these expenses and have a set salary for the first few months to budget our personal finances.

(Full disclosure:  what I import is proprietary to my business, so I cannot disclose exactly what the product is -- I will say it a common consumer good though and it is not counterfeit or dangerous).  <br/><br/>My gross margins are around 50% and profit margins hover around 25% to 30% per month.  Even at 14.59% annually, my business can easily cover the loan payment.

My expected bonus is 20% of my take home salary, so this year I should make approximately $96k.<br/><br/>My job is to structure the sale of asset-backed securities;  so rest assured I work in the institutional lending game every day.  In my mind, taking on this loan is an EXCELLENT risk adjusted return for any investor.<br/><br/>I am young and am not interested in ruining my credit for an $8,000 line!<br/><br/>I have approximately $35k in cash / stocks / bonds; $15k of residual value in my car.

       "  Hello:  Thank you for taking the time to read my request. I'm a recently engaged, hardworking professional in my mid-20's who is trying to start a new life with my partner, but several roadblocks have come up along the way.  I have always been a very honest, do-it-myself kind of person. Growing up in a lower middle class family, I worked and supported myself all throughout high school and college.   I currently work as a program director at a nonprofit organization that provides clinical, legal, and shelter services to domestic violence victims. It is a salaried position with full benefits (but the salary is at a typical nonprofit level). My partner is an artist/illustrator. We both work very hard and do not have a lavish lifestyle at all. We've tried to be frugal and save, but my partner recently had some legal, automobile, and medical costs to pay for which wiped out our savings.  My partner has sold the car, I have taken on a freelance job in addition to my full-time job, and now we are looking to move to a cheaper apartment as well as eventually get married. A loan of $10,000 would allow us to pay the last month's rent on the current apartment, pay for the security/first/last on a new, more affordable apartment, pay for moving expenses (we do not have much furniture or possessions), pay off my partner's legal and medical expenses, and maybe set aside some for our new life together.  I'm not proud to be requesting money from strangers because I've always tried to work my way through life and figure things out, but the situation has just become so tough and desperate with the fact I need to support my partner, and I would do anything for us to have a life together. Moving to a cheaper apartment and paying off the unexpected legal, automobile, and medical expenses will allow us to better manage our income and get back on our feet, and our top priority would be paying back this loan.  Also, I'm not quite sure how this process works as I've never done it before, but we currently live in New York but I was originally based in New Jersey, so that is why my location indicates New Jersey (we may also end up moving to New Jersey due to the more affordable rent).  Thank you for your time.     1\n",

       "  I am in the process of closing reducig my credit card debt. I don't like to consolidation process. it hurts my credit score. I read about lending club and would like to use this tool. The reason I have this credit debt is I both a house in Turkey and also had my first baby.

       "    Borrower added on 10/04/10 > This loan will be used to pay off my credit card balances and have a set fixed rate.  When I was in graduate school, I put myself in further debt by using my credit cards as a way to pay some of my expenses. Additionally, between graduation and beginning my job, I incurred medical expenses that I did not yet have insurance for.  That, plus high interest rates and voila - my situation! <br/><br/>I am a good candidate for this loan because I have already paid down my credit card debt by almost half. The only other debt I currently have is my home, my car,  and my student loans which are all in good standing and paid on time.  However, the interest rate I am still paying is making it hard for me to make a dent as quickly as I'd like.  As you can tell from my credit score, my lack of delinquencies, my debt to income, etc. I take my credit and paying back as quickly as I can very seriously. I chose the shortest loan option, but intend on paying it back as quickly as I absolutely can.

       "  Hello,  I own a company that makes Antenna Balls. (Things you put on your car antenna) I've owned this company for 10 years and need some capital for some new designs and display boxes.  I can easily get a loan at a bank....but who likes banks?? Plus, I love Internet companies and would like to support new ideas.  I have great credit and can pay the money back!

       "  My headgasket has blown, and the thing is falling apart and unsafe!  I need a new truck asap so I can outfit it to my liking and have it ready for when the snow melts and the work hits hard.    I am purchasing a 15K vehicle but I only want to put down about 9K now, so I would like to borrow 6,000.  I tried this a few weeks ago and the loan was 100% fullfilled by lenders, however, I did not realize that the club did not have my address before the loan expired.  So I faxed that in and now everything is good to go.

I am ready to live within my means again and have the financial freedom to buy my first home.Thanks for your consideration!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\n",

       "  My name is Nick Mouw and I own Abetterwatobuy Inc.  We warehouse app 400 SKUs (value app. $200,000) in an 1800 sq ft warehouse in Crete, IL. address if you want to google map it is 25621 S. Dixie Hwy, Unit 13D Crete, IL 60417 I started selling a few items from home in 1999 on Ebay and have since expanded to sell on Amazon, a web site and we supply products for Overstock.com.  Sales last Year topped $3,000,000 but admittedly are down app 15% this year. For that reason it is time to \"Get Serious\".  On ebay we are namou (55.000 + feedback) with an ebay store titled \"Abetterwaytobuy\". On Amazon we are \"Abetterwaytobuy\". But when we ship for Overstock it is in the Overstock name. It is safe to say that  if you buy a radar detector, CB Radio or Police scanner from Overstock there is a good chance it is actually coming from us. (we are 1 of several \"Overstock Partners\" that supply that type of merchandise for them.   The money will be used for:  1. Increasing Inventory I intend to increase inventory. ( the no. of SKUs) Width of inventory is the key to my business. There is not much risk involved as I can accurately predict what I can sell most anything for, as research is a close as any computer. I simply do not buy anything at a price that  does not allow  me to be among the very lowest price for any given item  online.   2.upgrading  my web site  www.abetterwaytobuy.net.    To date I have not spent any money on  design, on search engine optimization or on marketing said web site. I am confident the plans i have for the site will increase sales markedly.  In conclusioin, I am 56 yrs. old and to date have not left a single bill unpaid. I will not let this one ruin that record.

       "    Borrower added on 08/26/10 > I require the loan to cover the cost of 50% of the revolving debt of my recently ended marriage.  None of the debt is currently in my name so I need the loan to pay the cards and one account.

Interest rates are rapidly increasing and I would like to be in a much better position and not be caught up in the paying higher rates.   <br/>Thank you for you assistance...<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",

       "  I recently (November 2007) purchased a foreclosed property here in Ohio.  The home was purchased at a significant discount.  However, the property was in dire need of repair.  The repairs are nearing completion on the interior.  The repairs to the exterior and the cosmetic improvements to the home will require a little help from you out there.  The alloted amount in the loan would significantly advance my time table in the refurbishing of this home.

       "   With the economy in turmoil, I can't afford to buy a new car. So I would rather fix my daily driver back up to reliable standards. Considering the fact that I drive 60 plus miles per day to work, school, and back home, I would save more on gas and maintenance in the long run.

       "  To consolidate my credit cards, pay bills and use to finance my start up expenses so I can launch my business in retail (buying and selling). My business will open this May. The money will also help me get a certification as a Woman Minority Business Enterprise and it will increase my opportunity to bid for Federal and State loan as well as bid for a contract in the government and private sector. To be certified I have to pay a fee to process my application.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",

I need a bridge loan until mid-July when I begin work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n",

       "  Welcome and thank you for your inquiry,  My Name is Juan and a year ago my uncle (a contractor) was having a slump with out any business he asked me if i knew anything about the internet and how to get leads. We started looking a ServiceMagic.com and found it to be way to expensive and the leads where given not just to him but every contractor in the area. So by the time he called around the customer was just aggravated from to many calls. I took upon a task to built him a simple website that would get him the leads, but we notice this was not making any progress so i started to research how internet works and found google, yahoo and msn have great marketing and advertising tools that help out small business but although it was effective we found it to be expensive. I then realized a term called SEO/SEM (Search Engine Optimization/Search Engine Marketing) six months later after a few classes and plenty of research and books i was able get him top rankings for contractors in his area of business, best of all the website was getting natural ads in google, yahoo and msn top ten ads on those three search engines is tuff you not only need to be established but you have to be loud on the internet!! So we did it and he started getting his first 1-3calls a day then we turned to 5-10 and now we get roughly 7-15 calls but my avg is 7 calls during winter season when trees, fences and roofs have plenty of accidents and problems. We have yet to experience a summer but i could only imagine. My uncle and i agreed $10.00 a call was fair weather or not the job got done. He then referred a friend of his with a Janitorial Company and the model works for his business as well, so i decide to offer this great tool to other small business in the area. A bit hesitant to the new idea a lot of business turned me down but that didn't stop my persistence, so i offered the service Free for the first month. Yes I told them i would help your business succeed as long as you give me the chance to show you what i could do. After adding 4 more clients i found myself, not only creating and maintaining the websites but also doing the marking  on a daily basis for all 6 clients this included taking the initial call, tracking the calls, invoicing my clients, and lots of other business administration stuff that took a regular 12-15hr days after six months i noticed my health and wife were really getting sick of a workaholic so, I recently started looking for software that would do most of the marketing for me and i also found a outsourcing company that would take the calls, track the calls and best yet invoice my clients. I also need to higher a accountant, My focus will be in getting more clients and i found that to be easy with my 30 day free trial period with no risk to a small business. This loan will go along way and i am currently taking Video classes to help our clients get there message across to there customers.  best wishes to all,       1\n",

       "  Purpose of loan:  Hello, The purpose of this loan is to complete the renovation of the apartment complex. There is a total of 20 units in the complex 15 of the 20 have been completed. The property is 85% pre-leased, which means that as soon as I can complete the renovation I can move those tenants into there new homes. However city code will not allow me to occupy any of those units until the entire building is complete. This loan will be greatly needed. I do have certified workers standing by.   My financial situation: I have my current tax returns from the 2 past years to prove my income. My debt to income Ratio is on 11% Im not spening more then I can afford. My Equafax Credit Score is 780.

       "  This is such a fantastic site and concept, peer to peer lending!  I was told by a family member about it and figured I would give it a try.  I have a few smaller credit line credit cards currently open with very high interest rates as high as 28%!  I wish to pay all those off and cut them up, be rid of them...forever.    I work for a reputable law office with steady income and have extra available cash each month to ensure this loan will be paid on time each month.

Thanks for considering this loan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\n",
       "  I am a computer science student, 22 years old, at UMass Lowell. I have moved out of my parent's house and need some help paying for my last two years.  I will be graduating in 2009 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a minor in writing.  I have a steady work history in web applications and design for the past three years.  This loan will be used to cover part of my expenses for the next two years, including my tuition, car loan, housing, and supplies.  I have a part-time job during the school year, which will cover most of my expenses.  The loan will supplement this.  Thank you for your support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",
       "  I just graduated college and plan on getting married in about a year.  Unfortunatly I ran up a few credit card bills during college and now the interest rates and fees are killing me.  I really need to get them paid off and would much rather have only one payment of lets say 200 dollars than 4-5 payments of anywhere from 50-150 dollars each.  This would allow me to get my finances straight before i get married and get under controll.

       "  My goal is to pay off a high interest loan and pay off my credit cards and just have one payment to make with this loan.   I normally get a very good bonus at my job which I was going to use so that I would not have to carry a balance on my credit cards, however it has been delayed and I will probably not receive until January.  I have worked very hard this year to open new tradelines and rebuild my credit, with every intention of not carrying a balance over 60 days and paying these off with my bonus.  I will definately not be late paying any payments, as I am watching my score go up and intend to keep it that way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",
       "  We need to make some improvements in our home including kitchen upgrades, bathroom upgrades, home office improvements and build a workshop for my husband to work in. He is self employed and works with antiques and wood work.   He required heart surgery in May of this year and was not able to work for several months. We are currently paying back medical expenses that our insurance did not cover. We are both self employed and my office is in the home.   A workshop where my husband could work out of the elements would be very beneficial. He has been working outside on the carport and in the house! Needlessly to say this is diffcult on the house and our quality of life. He has recently been able to start back working and it sure would be easier if we had a place for him to work. I need to improve my office space as well.   I have my own business as a marketing and public relations consultant and a professional fundraiser. I have been doing this for over 25 years and decided to start my own business about 5 years ago. The coming year looks very good for me. I have found a niche working with cities and rural areas on finding funds for infrastructure such as water, sewer, community centers, etc. I work with the government a lot to secure funds. I also do a lot of work with nonprofit organizations. Currently, I have 5 regular nonprofit clients and 3 towns as clients as well as other agencies that I do periodic work for. It is rewarding work and I enjoy it. My office is getting cluttered and needs to be reorganized for better work conditions and to be able to have someone come in and help on occassion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",
       "  I was going to attend a convention, where I'd be visiting friends whom I haven't seen in a year, as a birthday gift to myself, but the transmission in my car all but died.

       "  I have several high interest credit cards that i would like to consolidate into one loan.  These accounts are going to be closed as soon as i pay the balance.  Bad decisions have led to this debt, but luckily my salary has increased and we can climb out of the hole and learn from our mistakes.  The total amount is just under $15000 which will leave a small amount to pay some medical bills.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n",
       "  I have a Credit Card that has a higher rate I would like to pay off. So instead of paying the banks the higher interest, I would rather pay off a fellow lendingclub member the interest rate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",

       "  I am asking for a loan to help out my wife. A year ago we decided to use a debt consolidation service for her debts to try to have the interest rates reduced. While it worked in this regard, we also must pay a high monthly payment, plus a monthly charge. I believe we can save money by getting a lower interest loan and using this money to pay off all of these creditors once and for all.  We have definitely learned our lesson about responsible credit.

       "  I have collected a decent amount of credit card debt over the last four years while in college. I am graduating this month with a BS in Computer Science.  I am already working as a contractor, but would like to pay off the high interest credit cards as quickly as possible and get a better rate/save some money.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",

       " Name: debt_settlement_flag_date, dtype: int64, 'desc': \\t Member# 809768, loan description. (trying to get more investors, doesn't look like we will make it to fully funded by deadline.) How I plan to use the funds: 16x28 Doughboy Pool with all accessories- $7,200 Pool Installation and bury- $2700 Deck surrounding the pool- $6000 Dirt Haul Away- $400 Credit Card payoff amounts: $1344.72, $838.95, and $521.82 What makes me a good borrower: In life I strive to achieve the best and with that I try my best to keep my credit in the best shape possible. I take pride in paying all my bills on time and even early. I have payed off my truck and will be paying off my other car off in March 2012. I have worked very hard to payoff all my credit cards and i'm down to the last three and with this loan they will be payed off which will save me on the interest rates. ??? My monthly budget: I bring home $2,800/month- (This is minus my car insurance, medical, 401 K, and taxes) Which comes out of my check each week.

       "      I would like to increase my cash availability mainly to potentially be used for emergencies. While my income to expese flow is solvent and I have some spare cash, I would like to protect myself against uncertainty and am willing to take a small loan out for it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1\n",

       "     For the past six years I have been working full time and part time (two part time jobs) to put myself through school. Unfortunately, this has been a strain on my schoolwork, but I have also kept a 3.2 GPA and last semester I even made the Dean’s List. I currently attend a major university part time and have been going to school for the past six years.  In the past I have been able to handle the stresses of working and going to school, but I graduate at the end of the year and I just found out a few days ago that I would need to complete three more classes this summer in order to graduate on time. This is very distressing news, because I work every single day during the summer months to pay for the following semester. I would like to graduate on time, it has been a very long six years and I want to be the first person in my family to have a college degree.  I do not want to push my graduation off any further.  I plan to graduate with a BA in Spanish History/Interrupter Education. I would like to be an Interrupter and also a Spanish Language Arts teacher after I graduate. Spanish language and learning about other countries has been a wonderful experience. I love learning about other cultures and studying this language has taught me so much about how other people live and how learning a new language has brought down so many barriers. So far I have not had a chance to travel oversees, but I plan to do so after my graduation.  I love attending school and I have been able to pay all of my education expenses so far, but these three classes will be a strain on me financially.  I want to be able to complete and pay for these three classes and always pay for the following semester and graduation fees.  Hopefully with this loan I can pay all of my school bills and not have to work part time so I can focus on my education and graduate on time and begin a new life and my new career.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\n",

       "    I am interested in taking out a loan for some money to update the kitchen in my house. I can easily afford a payment in the 300-350 range. I would be interested in borrowing 10,000-15,000.    I would be most interested in a line of credit, that I can reaccess for future home projects once I have paid off this initial loan. I thought a line of credit loan made more sense than a credit card due to interest rates.   I have good credit, and a good income, I just do not have much equity in my home so I have chosen not to refinance at this time.  thankyou                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",
       "    I currently make aprox. $4000 per month net. My motgage is my main monthly expense which is about $1580.  I have a live in fiance who pays for all utilities, cable, borough/county bills, etc.  I do not have a monthly car payment as I use company vehicles.  The only other monthly expenses i have are paying down these credit cards and other debts which I have and would like to combine into this one payment.  My job is extremely stable, and I can all but guarantee you that I will not lose my job anytime soon and will most likely work here till I retire.  Our company has grown each and every year that we have operated.  We started in 2004 and now have aprox 50-60 employees.

       "    I have $7,600.00 in credit card debt with an average interest rate of 22%.  With these balances I have a minimum monthly payment of $237.00.

       "    My son lives in Atlanta, GA with his father. He is going to school and is looking to find a job. He needs to have reliable transportation . Since his father is not willing or able to help, he asked me.     I have never taken out a loan so this would be good for my credit history. I don't like having debt hanging over my head, so I will get it paid off as quickly as possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1\n",
       "    This loan will be used to transfer the location of my current gym to another facility. I currently run a gym that offers boxing, mixed martial arts, and personal training. Presently the gym is located in an industrial park, and is inconvenient to our 131 members, due to the lack of parking. The goal of the gym is to grow and be a more accessible location.     There is a need for more equipment to accommodate the members. The current location is approximately 3,000 square feet, while the new location is roughly 5,000 square feet. At times members are forced to exercise close together.  Extra space will allow the addition of new equipment and there will be ample room for the members to work out. With the growth of membership space in the facility is scarce.     The current location of the gym is simply a loading bay. There is no air ventilation, and the gym gets rather hot and humid.  The new location will be beneficial because it has a ventilation system that would create a better comfort level to the members of the gym. Without proper ventilation we run the risk of people having heat related illnesses.     Overall the move to this new facility I will be able to better manage the everyday operations of the gym while providing a more comfortable environment for the members to work out. The new location will also provide an enhanced location that is easier to access for members. There will be more space for new equipment, ample space for all of the activities happening daily.      Iâm an excellent candidate for this loan because I manage my finances responsibly and maintain my credit by paying all of my bills on time. I have a long history of paying car payments and credit card bills on time. With a new location I will be able to acquire more profit for the gym which will be greatly beneficial towards paying the balance of this loan. The payment plan associated with this loan will fit well within my budget. Even if the forecasted growth of the gym was not as projected within the allotted timeline, payment of the loan would not be a hardship.

       "   528605 added on 11/09/09 > I am a responsible individual with good credit and a stable job that pays well.  Due to a recent divorce and unexpected bills, I incurred some credit card debt that I am currently paying down.  I would like to consolidate that debt into one monthly payment and not worry about variable APRs.  I would much rather pay you for my credit than the credit card companies and, in exchange, receive the comfort that comes along with knowing that my APR won't increase unexpectedly and I will have paid down my debt in three years.  Thank you for considering me as an investment opportunity!<br/> 528605 added on 11/10/09 > Two side notes: <br/><br/>1) My monthly budget for living expenses, including my mortgage, utilities, car, food, etc. is $2,950.00.<br/><br/>2) For those wondering about the difference between my revolving credit line and the amount of my loan request, I intend to pay off the difference with a yearly bonus (to be paid out at the end of November).<br/><br/>Many thanks to all who have invested in me so far!<br/>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\n",

With my new Research Associate postion at a Biopharmaceutical company I am now able to pay off my student debt. I intend on paying off this loan before the 3 year term mainly because I would like to purchase a new automobile once this loan is paid off and apply for an auto loan through this website.

Excellent business plan but it will not do much on its own.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",

Thanks for your consideration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1\n",
       "   547470 added on 10/25/09 > I have a Excellent Credit Score that I have worked very hard to get, I am not going to do anything to jepordize that. I have made all of my payments on time and payed off loans early. I assure you this is not a risky loan for anyone, you WILL get your money back and on time. A man's credit is as important as his name and I intend on mine always being at Excellent Status.

       " will be using the loan to pay off some high interest credit cards that I wound up with in a divorce. The cards were in my name but my wife and I both made purchases with them and since they weren't a joint account, I got left holding the debt. I have been making all my payments on time but when the banks raised the APR% due to the economy, the payments I have been making were basically paying the interest charges but not making much of a dent in the principle. I just paid my car off and am moving out of my 2 bed room apartment, and will use that extra money to continue working on getting out of debt and paying back this loan. I don't smoke, drink Starbucks, or eat out at expensive restaurants, and I have the lowest cable package that I can get. I am in saver mode. I have been employed full time at the same business for over 3 years. The company has been in business for over 30 years.

       " with the current environment, credit card companies are taking advantage of people, raising interest rates at will. It happened once, my APR was raised to over 25%, and i didn't notice it for 2 months.   I was able to get it back down to around 14% after a few phone calls. I would like to lock in an APR on some of this credit card debt, as a preemptive measure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n",

Please take a look at our work and consider funding our expansion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",
       " ~ STARTUPSNAX SMALL BUSINESS LOAN REQUEST ~  ABOUT THE FOUNDER:  I'm a four-time small business author and former editor for a major publishing company that has since resigned to pursue my small business consulting and the launch of StartupSnax.com.   I'm currently consulting on various small businesses that are taking their business online to maximize their sales.  ABOUT STARTUPSNAX:  StartupSnax.com, the provider of Daily Munchables for  Your Business, is a small business resource site centered around providing current and edgy content for the web 2.0/social media & networking entrepreneurial environment and to help anyone looking for a current site to find information on how to start their business cost-effectively (how about under $10,000?), time-efficiently (maybe in a matter of weeks?) and resourcefully (how do I make sure my business is green?).  WHAT DO WE OFFER?  With the resources of the industries keynote authors on various topics, we will be offering:  - StartupSnax Blog - StartupSnax Free Stuff! - StartupSnax Ebook Store - StartupSnax RSS Feed and Newsletter  The authors of these ebooks are major industry writers that will be using their current substantial sales platforms (their websites, speaking engagements, newsletters, radio events, online blogs and webinars, book signings, and various other PR opportunities, etc) to direct traffic towards our site in addition to our online marketing, SEO and online traffic efforts. They will be using the site as a marketing vehicle for their various works and expertise.   HOW DO YOU MAKE MONEY?  Ebooks:  Ebooks have been increasing in YTD (past year to date) sales more than any other product in the publishing industry! Publishers Weekly (www.PublishersWeekly.com) has been quoting that although various in-store sales have been down over previous YTD sales, ebooks have been continuing to increase with the lowest overhead and highest profit margins! Better yet, trade ebook sales (business, not fiction) have been doing well despite the hardcopies' decrease in sales due to the economic slump.  Fortunately, since we are only offering these professionally-edited, written and designed ebooks in digital format, we are saving the cost of printing them, and staying GREEN as well!  By offering smaller (snackable!) ebooks in a condensed format by major authors similar to the Cliff Notes for small business and offering these ebooks at an impressive price point of less than $10, by maximizing traffic, we are sure of substantial ebook sales numbers based upon industry trends.   Ad Sales:  We have not calculated the inevitable ad revenue that will be garnered from providing a pivotal ebook store and resource site into our breakeven analysis but it is a buffer to ensure that we are profitable in the first two months.  WHY DO YOU NEED A LOAN?  A loan is a buffer for guaranteed success. Each person and company should have an emergency fund of at least three months' worth of working capital especially in this economy. Although we could  launch without a loan, although difficult, we are ensuring the success of a solid business plan in the case of a substantial interest in the company at the launch and the need for fast growth.  My credit is exceptional and this is not my only form of income since I'm also consulting, but I always advise my clients that cash is king! In the effort to keep the marketing budget at its peak, I need a loan to ensure those efforts. Also, the ebooks are being professionally copyedited and designed for ideal quality and I'm utilizing an industry leader as a production editor.  WHAT CAN I SEE NOW?  You can view the parked page at www.StartupSnax.com.  Our blog goes live mid November with a final site launch slated for January 1st!         1\n",
